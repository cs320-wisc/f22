# Lab 3: Git

Activities:

1. share with your group: *if you could create a silly law, what would it be?*

2. practice using the [Git Simulator](./git-sim)

3. try [merging branches](./git-conflict) and conflict resolution

4. create a GitHub account and learn how to create a [pull request](./git-pr) to suggest changes to repos on GitHub that you don't own
